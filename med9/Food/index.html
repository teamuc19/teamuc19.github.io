	It takes less than 30 minutes to make Pasta Arrabiata from scratch. It is a fiery and spicy tomato-based red sauce that you can slather over a bowlful of spaghetti, penne, or any pasta of your choice. Serve it along with some light salad and garlic bread for a full dinner.It is spelled as arrabbiata or arrabiata too.When you go to an Italian restaurant Penne all Arrabiata or Spaghetti Arrabbiata is always on the menu.The word arrabbiata sounds fancy!!! It means “angry” in Italian.So, this red sauce pasta is actually very hot and spicy as compared to other Italian sauces.

		The heat comes from crushed red peppers simmered in the sauce.I like to make pasta arrabiata at home with homemade spicy sauce.It takes less than 20 minutes to make the sauce and you can adjust the heat to your taste.At home, everything is very customizable.
